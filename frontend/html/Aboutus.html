		<p><b>A canteen is a store that sells food and drink at an institution like a camp, college, or military base. 
            A canteen can also be a small container used to carry water to drink.
            College canteen is not just a place for students to grab a bite,
            but it's also a place to hang out where they get all the entertainment to beat their blues away and so it is a
            popular hub on the campus both for physical nourishment and for student bonding.
            food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat, 
            and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy.
            The absorption and utilization of food by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion.
